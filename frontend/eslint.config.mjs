// Project ESLint — flat config.
//
// This file is the instrument that `ADR-011/D4` adopted IN PLACE OF two `[[rules.own]]`
// regexes (`ts-explicit-any`, `ts-browser-console`). The reason is measured and is not a
// matter of taste: over a universe of 3 files / 4 lines, neither regex variant is
// simultaneously complete and correct — the narrow one (`:\s*any\b`) misses
// `Record<string, any>` and `Map<string, any>`, the wide one (`\bany\b`) reports an
// object key, and JSX TEXT defeats both. An AST distinguishes `TSAnyKeyword` from an
// `Identifier` and from a `JSXText`: they are different nodes, not text coincidences.
//
// The two rules below are the exact equivalents of the two rules that were dropped, and
// they are pinned here EXPLICITLY rather than inherited from a preset, so that a preset
// upgrade cannot silently downgrade them to `warn`.
//
// NOTE, superseded 2026-08-28 by `T-01.5` -- kept because it names the two pieces that
// had to arrive: this linter used to be INSTALLED and not a gate, because `test_cmd` is
// read by no gate and the `pre-push` hook did not run `make`. Both pieces landed:
// `ADR-011/D2` (`Makefile`, `T-01.6`) and `D3b` (`scripts/hooks/pre-push.pre-harness`,
// `T-01.5`). `make lint` now runs from `pre-push`, and the evidence the old note asked
// for exists: with a `.tsx` carrying `any` + `console`, `git push --dry-run` is REFUSED
// (rc=1) and ACCEPTED (rc=0) once the file is removed
// [MEASURED 2026-08-28, isolated bench clone; see frontend/README.md section 4].
// `test_cmd.web` is still NOT declared -- that is a separate decision, and it belongs to
// whoever owns the `web` component.
